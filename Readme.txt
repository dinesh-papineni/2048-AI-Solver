Developed a 2048 Game with an Artificial Intelligent solver.
The project in implemented in Java.The source directory consists of 3 packages - algorithm, systemModel and ui. 
The 'ui' package contains a class called 'GameMain'. Run that to execute the ui version of the game.
There is also a class in 'ui' called 'ConsoleGame', which can be used to play the game in the console mode.
We have also included a javadoc documentation of all the classes and methods we have used.
There is an executable jar file included in this folder where you can play the game directly without running the code.
Controls: The 4 arrow keys move the tiles in the 4 directions. The 'A' key runs the algorithms, calculates the best move and applies one move. 
Note that, it applies only one move at one key press. Hold down 'A' key for continuous moves.
