The folder called 'Java Code' contains the 2048 solver project file called '2048game'.
Inside the project file are 3 packages - algorithm, systemModel and ui. The 'ui' package contains a class called 'GameMain'. Run that to execute the ui version of the game. There is also a class in 'ui' called 'ConsoleGame', which can be used to play the game in the console.
We have also included a javadoc documentation of all the classes and methods we have used.

There is an executable jar file included in this folder where you can play the game directly without running the code.

Controls: The 4 arrow keys move the tiles in the 4 directions. The 'A' key runs the algorithms, calculates the best move and applies one move. Note that, it applies only one move at one key press. Hold down the key for continuous moves.
